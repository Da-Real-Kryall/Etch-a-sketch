# Etch-a-sketch
an etch-a-sketch made with python and the turtle library, when i had just started learning python years ago

it should run just with a python (â‰¤3.6) interpreter, as follows:
`python3 <file/path.py>`

for info on the controls you can press 'h' when running it, but most of them are intuitive.
or you can look at the help.txt file.
